          <p>
            Known in Chinese as 統一發票 (Tǒngyī Fāpiào), the bi-monthly receipt
            invoice lottery in Taiwan was created to encourage legal tax
            reporting by giving consumers an incentive to purchase at stores
            that legally report sales taxes. Every two months, lottery numbers
            are randomly drawn that correspond to the eight numbers printed
            along the top of vendors' receipts and posted on a Taiwanese
            government website.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the chances of winning the lottery for the smallest amount are
            relatively high (approximately 1/200 receipts), many people in
            Taiwan will store their receipts and check them when the new lottery
            numbers are posted. However, this process involves checking by eye
            each 8-digit receipt number against the several winning numbers
            posted online which, depending on the number of receipts, can be
            tedious and time consuming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, I wrote a Python program that can check a Google Sheets
            file full of lottery numbers input by a user (via scanning the QR
            code located on the receipt) against the winning lottery numbers
            posted online by the Taiwanese government every two months. The user
            then receives an email with any winning numbers. This program saves
            hours of time and effort in playing this lottery. I tested my app
            over a two month period with my own saved receipts. As a result I
            personally won the lottery twice for the smallest amount (~$10).
          </p>
          <p>
            If I were to extend the project further I would create a mobile app
            that could automatically check the lottery after the QR code for the
            receipt was scanned.
